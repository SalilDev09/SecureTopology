This project aims to automate the design of secure, scalable, and optimized network topologies. By integrating network engineering principles, security best practices, and AI-driven optimization, it addresses common challenges such as slow, error-prone manual designs, security gaps, and scalability issues in large enterprises, data centers, and IoT environments.

Features

Automated Network Discovery: Scans devices and gathers metadata (IP, MAC, OS, type) using SNMP, NetFlow, and SDN controllers.

Secure Topology Generation: Builds optimized network graphs with integrated security measures like firewalls, ACLs, VPNs, and zero-trust architecture.

AI-Driven Optimization: Utilizes graph theory algorithms (shortest path, minimum spanning tree, k-connectivity) and machine learning to balance cost, performance, and security.

Simulation & Testing: Conducts virtual penetration testing and simulates attacks (e.g., DDoS, MITM) to ensure robustness.

Dynamic Scaling: Adapts topology when new devices join, supporting multi-cloud and IoT environments.

Compliance Assurance: Ensures adherence to standards like ISO 27001, NIST, and the Indian IT Act.

System Architecture

Discovery Module: Scans and lists devices.

Topology Generator: Builds optimized, secure graphs.

Security Enforcer: Applies firewalls, ACLs, and encryption.

Visualization Dashboard: Provides an interactive network map.

Technology Stack

Backend: Python (NetworkX, Scapy), Go, or C++ for speed.

Visualization: D3.js, Gephi, Neo4j.

Security: Snort/Suricata IDS, firewall APIs.

SDN Integration: OpenDaylight, ONOS.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SalilDev09/SecureTopology.git
cd SecureTopology


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the application:

python main.py

Usage

Scan Network: Use the discovery module to scan and list all connected devices.

Generate Topology: The topology generator will create an optimized, secure network graph.

Apply Security Measures: The security enforcer will apply necessary firewalls, ACLs, and encryption protocols.

Visualize Network: Use the visualization dashboard to view and interact with the network map.

Evaluation Metrics

Time Efficiency: Compare the time taken to generate topology versus manual setup.

Network Performance: Assess improvements in latency and throughput.

Security Compliance: Evaluate adherence to security standards and reduction in vulnerabilities.

Error Reduction: Measure the decrease in misconfigurations and security gaps.

Impact

Enterprises: Accelerates and secures IT setup processes.

Data Centers: Facilitates scalable and adaptive network designs.

Governments: Enhances security for critical infrastructure.

Startups: Provides easy deployment without requiring large IT teams.
